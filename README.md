# STDSR-2023-Assignment-2

The code comprises three separate sections that perform different tasks:

The first section creates an animated plot of paths between cities in Russia. It sets up the plot, fetches the coordinates for the cities, and plots GeoJSON data for the country's borders. It then animates the paths between the cities, displaying the current temperature and path distance at each step.

The second section plots the convergence of path distances based on different cooling factors. It generates a line graph that shows how the path distance evolves with each repetition, using different cooling factors for comparison.

The third section loads GeoJSON data for Russia and extracts the coordinates from the first feature in the dataset. It then flattens the nested list of coordinates into a one-dimensional list for further processing or analysis.
